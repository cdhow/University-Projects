      Gambit is a free mobile application built for both
      IOS and Android devices. The purpose of the app is
      to provide the user with a tool for tracking their
      own gambling statistics, which in turn could also
      have the effect of the realisation of a potential
      gambling addiction. The application works by receiving
      three inputs from the user, ‘Bet Amount’, ‘Final Amount’
      and ‘Date’. These three variables are inputted
      each time the user undertakes in a betting
      session, the inputs are then used to
      calculate multiple useful statistics
      such as individual gambling session
      results, overall earnings/losses,
      graphs that plot results over
      different time periods, etc.
